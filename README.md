# Game Rental system

**Project Description:** Game Rental System with C# and .NET Framework

Our database project focuses on developing a comprehensive game rental system using C# and the .NET Framework. This system includes two primary panels: the Admin Panel and the Game Panel, enabling efficient management of customers and games, respectively.

**Admin Panel:** The Admin Panel serves as the control center for managing customer data within the game rental system. Key features of the Admin Panel include:

-   Customer Management: The ability to add new customers, update existing customer information, and handle customer requests.
-   Rental Management: Tracking rented games, due dates, and facilitating the return process.
-   Customer Analytics: Generating reports and statistics regarding customer activities and preferences.

**Game Panel:** The Game Panel provides an overview of the games available for rental and their respective statuses. Notable features of the Game Panel include:

-   Game Catalog: A comprehensive list of available games with detailed information such as genre, rating, and availability.
-   Rental Status: Tracking which customers have rented specific games, along with the rental duration and due dates.
-   Game Updates: Facilitating game additions, removals, or updates to keep the catalog up-to-date.

**Database Integration:** To ensure seamless functionality, the project integrates a robust database system. The database stores essential information, such as customer profiles, game details, rental history, and administrative controls. This integration allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, enhancing the overall performance and user experience of the game rental system.

Overall, this database project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for managing a game rental system. With the Admin Panel and Game Panel, administrators can easily handle customer data, monitor game rentals, and make informed decisions based on analytics. By leveraging C# and the .NET Framework, we deliver a reliable and scalable system that meets the demands of modern game rental businesses.

Note: This description provides a concise overview of the project's key components and functionalities. Further details, such as specific database design and user interface aspects, can be discussed and tailored to meet the project's requirements.
